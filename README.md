## Cellular Automata Modeling Project
This is a group project on cellular automata inspired by Conway's Game Of Life written in OCaml.

### Timeline

**April 4, 2019** - Implemented a one dimensional cellular automata that generates 8 generations from a provided generation 0. 
**April 11, 2019** - Begin implementation on 2d cellular automata.
**April 15, 2019** - 2d CA generations now are generated; but with no rules.
**April 15, 2019** - 2d CA implemented with rules by Conway.


### Examples

**Conway's Simple Rules aka Butterfly**
