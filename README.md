# Cellular Automata Modeling Project
This is a group project on cellular automata inspired by Conway's game of life written in OCaml.


## Timeline

April 4, 2019 - Implemented a one dimensional cellular automata that generates 8 generations from a provided generation 0. 

April 11, 2019 - Begin implementation on 2d cellular automata.

April 15, 2019 - 2d CA generations now are generated; but with no rules
